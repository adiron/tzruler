## What is this thing?

**tzruler**, aka *timzone ruler* is tool to compare timezones, in the present, future and past. It is a simple and opinionated tool.

The idea came to me because I work with people in many different timezones. At one time, I had to schedule a meeting across 3 timezones, some ahead, some behind me. I wondered if there was a way to put the timezones side-by-side and compare. Unhappy with existing solutions online I made *tzruler*.
