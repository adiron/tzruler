## What is this thing?

I have colleagues in many different timezones. Usually, you'd get used to people's working hours, and consult their calendar. However, occasionally a question would come up such as, "how about 3:30pm EST?", which has me to calculating timezones in my head - usually unsuccessfully.

There are many solutions to this issue out there, but I didn't feel like they were precisely what I had in mind. And besides I love a good project.
